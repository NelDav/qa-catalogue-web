# A single page web interface for searching MARC records

This web interface is created mainly for research purposes. It uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS, the backend is a Solr index, which is created by the [metadata-qa-marc](https://github.com/pkiraly/metadata-qa-marc) project. Solr contains not pure MARC21 fields, but the so called [Self-descriptive MARC21 codes](http://pkiraly.github.io/2017/09/24/mapping/).
